Awesome window manager is with no doubt the most customizable and configurable WM use can use.It has a great and probably the best documentation and the selling point (figuratively) is the widgets system. But it does not stop at this point, since it uses the scripting language =lua=  to write the configuration file, you can extende it to do whatever you want.

The main configuration file of lua is =rc.lua= which has to be located at =XDG_CONFIG_HOME/awesome/rc.lua=. After installing AwesomeWM for the first time, this file has to be copied from =/etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua=, and the other important file is the theme configuration file which has to be located at =XDG_CONFIG_HOME/awesome/themes/theme.lua=.

My way of configuring AwesomeWM is by splitting the configuration into separte modules, each module is resposible for a certain function, to make it easier for trubleshooting and implementing new modules. My =rc.lua= has calls for each module being used.
** Important notes
- Note 1: keep in mind that the =Right alt= key works only for the *Spanish keyboard layout*. For other layouts you should assign a different key.
- Note 2: I personally use =kitty terminal= since it's gpu accelerated and has a better Arabic support than others like =alacritty=.
- Note 3: You can get a list of all keybindings in AwesomeWM by pressing =Super + s=.
** Useful keybindings to get started
| Key                | Function                  |
|--------------------+---------------------------|
| =Super + Enter=      | Open terminal             |
| =Super + Shift + c=  | Close any open window     |
| =Super + Shift + r=  | restart AwesomeWM         |
| =Super + Shift + q=  | kill AwesomeWM            |
| =Super + p=          | open dmenu launcher       |
| =Super + c=          | open chromium browser     |
| =Super + f=          | open pcmanfm file manager |
| =Right alt + escape= | open power menu           |
* Main configuration File (rc.lua)
The first section in the configuration file is importing some of the builtin libraries
- *IMPORTANT* /bling is a module not written by me and we have to git clone it into the modules directory/
#+begin_src lua :tangle rc.lua
  pcall(require, 'luarocks.loader')
  local gears = require('gears')
  local awful = require('awful')
  local beautiful = require('beautiful')
  require('awful.autofocus')
  require('menubar')
  require('awful.hotkeys_popup')
  require('awful.hotkeys_popup.keys')
  local bling = require('modules/bling')
#+end_src
And then we specify the location of the theme file
#+begin_src lua :tangle rc.lua
  local config_dir = gears.filesystem.get_configuration_dir()
  beautiful.init(config_dir .. "themes/theme.lua")
#+end_src
At this point we import our modules
#+begin_src lua :tangle rc.lua
  require('keys')
  require('tags')
  --require('top_bar')
  require('bottom_bar')
  require('Menu')
  require('notifications')
  require('rules')
#+end_src
Enable windows switcher module provided by bling
#+begin_src lua :tangle rc.lua
  bling.widget.window_switcher.enable {
      type = "thumbnail", -- set to anything other than "thumbnail" to disable client previews

      -- keybindings (the examples provided are also the default if kept unset)
      hide_window_switcher_key = "Escape", -- The key on which to close the popup
      minimize_key = "n",                  -- The key on which to minimize the selected client
      unminimize_key = "N",                -- The key on which to unminimize all clients
      kill_client_key = "q",               -- The key on which to close the selected client
      cycle_key = "Tab",                   -- The key on which to cycle through all clients
      previous_key = "Left",               -- The key on which to select the previous client
      next_key = "Right",                  -- The key on which to select the next client
      vim_previous_key = "h",              -- Alternative key on which to select the previous client
      vim_next_key = "l",                  -- Alternative key on which to select the next client
  }
#+end_src
I don't use all the default layouts provided in the original =rc.lua=
#+begin_src lua :tangle rc.lua
  awful.layout.layouts = {
      awful.layout.suit.tile,
      awful.layout.suit.spiral.dwindle,
      awful.layout.suit.fair.horizontal,
      awful.layout.suit.max.fullscreen,
      awful.layout.suit.floating,
  }

#+end_src
Garbage collection (allows for lower memory consumption)
#+begin_src lua :tangle rc.lua
  collectgarbage('setpause', 110)
  collectgarbage('setstepmul', 1000)
#+end_src
* Top Bar (top_bar.lua)
My top bar is divided into two zones: left and right section.
- On the left section:
1. An icon which when clicked opens the menu
2.  Tags which are color coded
  - Active tag has a background
  -  Urgent tag (say for example if you have a web browser open on tag 2 and you clicked on a click in document open in tag 3, then tag 2 is called urgent)
- On the right section:
  - Number of available updates and total number of installed packages
  - Free space on home partition
  - Used memory
  - cpu utilization
  - Average load
  - Uptime
  - Monitor brightness
  - Date and time
  - Volume
  - keyboard layout

* Salat (Prayer) widget
This widget pull the times using =curl=, =systemd=, =mpv= and a bash script located at =~/.local/bin=
- Make sure that you have a =bin= directory inside the =.local= directory and the script =prayerTimes.sh= is stored there!
- Also make sure that the =bin= directory is added to your path.
- Edit the coordinates, city, country, method and adjustment in the =prayerTimes.sh= to suite your current location.
 - =curl= is used to download the times to a json file.
 - =mpv= is used to play the Azan
 - =systemd= is used to schedule the download time
- Create a directory inside the =.config= and name it =systemd=, and inside it another directory called =user=.
- Create two files inside =.config/systemd/user=, =prayerTimes.service= and =prayerTimes.timer=. These two files are stored in this repository, so you can copy and paste theme directly.
- Enable the service and timer using the following commands:
 - =systemctl --user enable --now prayerTimes.service=
 - =systemctl --user enable --now prayerTimes.timer=
- The timer will update automatically each 8 hours
