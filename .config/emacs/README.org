* GNU Emacs
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle init-test.el
The time to start using /Emacs/ has finally arrived. /Emacs/ is not just a text editor, it is everything you can imagine. It can open web pages, read your email, organize your life and alot more.But I don't use it for these great features, my only motive to start learning and using /Emacs/ is its great capability of handling Arabic texts.The main configuration file is =init.el= and over time it will increase in size as I learn more about this great peice of software and add more stuff to it.I don't know anything about the Lisp language and I don't claim to know it but I'll be looking at the documentation and reading about the /Emacs/ lisp to make it great.I know what other /Emacs/ users say about Org mode and it is the killer feature of /Emacs/, but for me it still very early to judge if this claim is true or not.
