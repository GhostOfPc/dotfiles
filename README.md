In this repository I store and share my dotfiles of my main desktop and laptop machines. 
The repo will grow in size and with time I'll organize it well
# Dependencies
I'm on Arch linux because it makes it really easy to install all the packages I need to build the system. This does not mean that other distros don't work or they are bad; but I prefer to keep it simple.

## Window Manager

## Web Browser
My daily driver web browser is brave browser which is a chromium based browser with a lot of privacy features  
I also use qutebrowser which is a keyboard driven broswer and highly customizable  
The custom startpage I'm using can be found under `.config/qutebrowser/html` which is not mine since I don't know hot to create one from scratch. I just modified it to suite my needs and taste.

# Important note!!!
The widget at the right side of the screen and the bottm bar in Arabic is the prayer times.  
I'm a muslim person and proud of that and I like GNU/Linux so please don't think that muslims can't use tech.  
May Allah protect all of us.
