# dotfiles
In this repository I store and share my dotfiles of my main desktop and laptop machines. 
The repo will grow in size and with time I'll organize it well
# Dependencies
I'm on Arch linux because it makes it really easy to install all the packages I need to build the system. This does not mean that other distros don't work or they are bad; but I prefer to keep it simple.
