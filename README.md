In this repository I store and share my dotfiles of my main desktop and laptop machines. 
The repo will grow in size and with time I'll organize it well
# Dependencies
I'm on Arch linux because it makes it really easy to install all the packages I need to build the system. This does not mean that other distros don't work or they are bad; but I prefer to keep it simple.

I manage this dotfiles using a method provided by a gentelman called StreakyCobra on [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles)

## Window Manager

## Web Browser
After being a firefox user for more than a decade, I switched to qutebrowser and I can't be happier.\
The custom startpage I'm using can be found under .config/qutebrowser/html which is not mine since I don't know hot to create one from scratch. I just modified it to suite my needs and taste.
