* gnuEmacs
  The time to start using Emacs has finally arrived.

  Emacs is not just a text editor, it is everything you can imagine. It can open web pages, read your email, organize your life and alot more.

  But I don't use it for these great features, my only motive to start learning and using Emacs is its great capability of handling Arabic texts.
